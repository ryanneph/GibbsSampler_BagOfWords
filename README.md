# Gibbs Sampler for Bag-Of-Words Topic Inference

Gibbs sampler for the 2 class bag-of-words topic clustering problem applied to document word count datasets downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words

The sampler draws samples from conditional distributions over the full state space vector to infer the latent parameters indicating document topic and topic specific word occurence probabilities.
